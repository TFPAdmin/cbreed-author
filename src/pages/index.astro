  <!-- About Me Section -->
  <div class="main-section">
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>I am <strong>C. B. Reed</strong>! I am an <strong>Up and Coming ALASKAN</strong> author!</p>
    <p>I have lived in Alaska more than half my life and I absolutely LOVE it. It's my home!</p>
    <p>I’ve loved reading since middle school and have been dabbling in writing since high school. I finally thought: “Why not? I've had this dream long enough—it’s time to turn it into reality!” So now here we are: I’m working on my first book and learning to code my own website while doing it!</p>
    <p>Once I finish my first book, I'll figure out how to link it on Amazon or Apple Books. No Barnes & Noble yet—I'm self-publishing for now, but who knows what the future holds?</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you have any questions or ideas for one of my books, let me know!</p>
    <p>You can email me at <a href="mailto:book_ideas@cbreedauthor.com">book_ideas@cbreedauthor.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>My Current Project!</h2>

      <p>I am currently working on a book I think everybody will love. It’s about a young man who finds out that his entire life is a lie. His mom has some explaining to do—and she better speak fast before he does something he’ll regret.</p>
