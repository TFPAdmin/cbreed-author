        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
        <p>I am <strong>C. B. Reed</strong>! I am an <strong>Up and Coming ALASKAN</strong> author!</p> 
		<p>I have lived in Alaska more than half my life and I absolutley LOVE it. It's my home!</p>
		<p>I have had a love of reading since Middle School (JR High depending on where you're from) and have been dabbling in writing a book since High School</p>
		<p>I finally thought "Why not, I've had this dream long enough, it's time to turn it in to reality, let's do this thing"</p>
		<p>And now here we are, working on finishing up my first book and learing to code a website while doing it!</p>
		<p>Once I finish my first book I'll figure out how to add a link to buy it on Amazon or the Apple Books Store</p>
		<p>Sorry, no Barnes and Noble yet, I'm self publishing, maybe some day I'll get in to big book stores</p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
		<p></p>
        <p>If you have any questions or if you have some ideas for one of my books, let me know!</p>
        <p>You can email them to me at <a href="mailto:book_ideas@cbreedauthor.com">book_ideas@cbreedauthor.com</a>.</p>

            <p>I am currently working on a book I think everybody will love. It is about a young man who finds out that his entire life is a lie. His mom has some explaining to do! And she better speak fast before he does something heâ€™ll regret.</p>
