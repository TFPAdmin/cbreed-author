		On his 14th birthday, Damien discovers that his life as he knows it, has been a lie. His name isn't Damien, his family isn't poor, he isn't a commoner. His mom, if she really is his mom, has some explaining to do.

			"Damien, wake up, it's your birthday! You're 14 now! And things are about to change for you. There are some things I need to tell you." Mom says.
			She continues talking, quieter now, like shes talking to herself. "So much is going to change for you Ciel, so much is going to change."
			I look at her in confusion. "Who's Ciel?"
			Mom looks at me sadly, she turns and starts to walk out the door, right as she starts to disappear, she says "You are, baby boy. You are."
